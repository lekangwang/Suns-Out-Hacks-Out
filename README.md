An interactive and informative cooking site, dedicated to various meats and preparations. Summer is prime time for BBQs and get-togethers with family and thereâ€™s no greater let-down than having sub-bar BBQ or roast. We aim to repair your pride by giving you life-changing tips to up your meat game. </br> </br>

This was an original project that we came up with as a group after the theme was announced on Saturday, August 29 10:00 am EST on the twitch stream for Suns Out Hacks Out. In our team of 3, only 1 teammate had prior experience with hackathons, and primarily had experience with mobile apps. This hackathon experience has been a rewarding learning experience, as it allowed all of us too step out of our comfort zone and helped use practise our web development skills.
